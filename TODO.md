# TODOs
- [ ] get rid of the seed object
- [ ] figure out the naming of the types (should it be Yield / Done) 
- [ ] Does first pay it's rent? 
- [ ] Can first just be a struct?
- [ ] Update the readme to explain very clearly what type of coroutine library this is. 
    - I.E. it's cooperative coroutines that don't run their own threads or don't run in parallel
    - You can make those other types of coroutines via tokio runtime shenanigans and async/await anyway
- [ ] The trait "First" seems like a bad name for what it is 
    - It's more like First represents continuations that have an initial request. 
    - I.E. there's two types of continuations: ones where they begin by requesting something from the handler, and others where the handler requests first.
    - To support both cont has two traits. First and Cont. 
- [ ] Add a way to yield from some inner continuation of the same type. 
- [ ] Add a way to chain based on an iterator of other conts.
- [ ] Add iter methods to turn conts and firsts into iterators
- [ ] idea: 
    - First is called InitCont (it's a thing that initializes into a cont by first yielding)
- [ ] Should ContExt and FirstExt exist or can we move those into their own extensions? 
- [ ] We should have features for Cont's and First's that will return a result type
- [ ] Ideas: 
    - Create a chain on iterators
    - Create a chain that creates a chain of firsts then the new type returns a vec of dones. 
- [ ] it's hard to use the handle functions if the handler throws an error
